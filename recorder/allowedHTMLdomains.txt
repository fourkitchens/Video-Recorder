# This configuration file can be used to specify the domains which are  
# allowed to host an HTML file which can possibly embed a client .swf file 
# for Live (out of the box) application. By default, this authentication is 
# disabled 
#
#  - There can be at most one domain entry per line e.g. to add domains 
#    http://myhost1.com and https://www.abc.myhost2.com the corresponding entries should be:
#
#	myhost1.com
#	www.abc.myhost2.com
#    		
#    	NOTE: There must not be any space character in the line containing a domain entry. 
# 	Such entries are discarded by this application after logging a warning Message .
#
#  - Adding an entry for a domain also allows all its subdomains to have file hosting 
# permission.
#
#  - An Asterisk (*) can be used to allow all domains to successfully authenticate. 
#
#  - Applicable only for the cases when the html page is accessed through http/https URL.
#
 


#
# To enable domain name based authentication for HTML file hosts, remove the following *  
# and add new entries.
